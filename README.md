# personal_website

### Details
During my senior year of high school (2020-21), I created a website in my dual enrollment data structures class. I designed each page using HTML and CSS, and I also embedded multiple JavaScript projects I had done throughout the year. As such, the webpage displays my proficiency with web design and my creativity with coding assigments.
